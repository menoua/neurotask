This task consists of three 5-minute blocks of speech.

Each block consists of a sequence of syllables that don't necessarily make words.

Once in a while, three connected syllables will make a proper English word.

Listen carefully for those words.

One of those proper words is "Objective". Any time you hear "Objective", press the key provided to you.

At the end of each block, a multiple choice question will ask what words you did NOT hear during the task.
