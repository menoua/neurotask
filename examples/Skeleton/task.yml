# Global user interface options
# If a subset or all of these features are omitted, the default values will be used
global:
  window_size: 900 x 780 # Outer size of the program window in pixels
  min_window_size: 800 x 700 # Minimum allowed window size in pixels
  content_size: 700 x 0.82 # Inner size of content, either as pixels or fraction of outer window
  resizable: true # Whether to allow resizing the window by user

  text_alignment: center # One of left, center, or right

# Task configuration options
#     All configurations are of form [ value, true/false ]. The value determines the
#     default value for the configuration, while the true/false determines whether
#     that value should be forced. Any configuration items set to false will be
#     configurable from within the program by the user.

#     rate and the same number of samples.
