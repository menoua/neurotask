# Instructions for running the Trisyllabic task

## Description

The task consists of 3 5-minute blocks. Each block is a series of randomly ordered English syllables that will sometimes line up to form a proper 3-syllable English word.

## Subject

The subject should be asked to listen to the stimulus and identify the proper words within the stimulus.

To make sure they are paying attention, every time they hear the word "Objective", they should press the key provided to them.

At the end of each block there is a multiple choice question asking the subject which words they did not hear so far during the task. There is only one unspoken answer in each question, but 0 or multiple answers are also accepted.

## Running the task

There are two ways to run the task--using Matlab or system binaries (macOS and linux only). Both ways are functionally identical, i.e., the content of the task is the same. But the Matlab version has some quirks due to Matlab's limitations.

To run the binary versions, make sure the resources folder is in the same directory as the executable (trisyllabic-maci64 for macOS or trisyllabic-linux64 for linux) and just run it as you would any other app. (If on macOS, you will need to "Right Click -> Open" the first time instead of a double-click)

To run the task through Matlab, make sure you have a Matlab version 2016 or above, go to the directory that contains the .mlapp file, make sure the resources folder is also in the same folder, and just type in "Trisyllabic" at the Matlab prompt.

The 3 blocks should preferably be run in order (1->2->3). The completion of a block is indicated by a change of color.

Due to Matlab's handling of key presses, there is an extra calibration step when using the "system keyboard" configuration. After starting a block, the light will turn blue indicating the keyboard needs to be calibrated. To do so, click on an empty space of the task window and press "space bar" once. The light will turn orange and the task will start.

To stop a block before it completes (started by mistake, loud interruption, etc.) you just need to press the "escape" key twice in fast succession. If a block is stopped prematurely, you will need to start it from the beginning. On Matlab, again, you might have to click on an empty space of the window before the "escape" key works.

The task generates log files containing configuration, subject reactions and question responses, and stores them in a directory called "output".

## Configuration

There are two configuration options for the task--audio and input. If unsure, leave both at their default values.

There are two setups for the audio output:

1. Audio at left channel, trigger at right channel (default/preferred): In this case an audio left-right splitter should be used to separate the stimulus from the trigger and connect the stimulus to the speaker and the trigger to the recording system.

2. Audio at both channels: In this case a regular splitter should be used to connect the audio to both the speaker and the recording system.

As part of the task, the subject should react to the word "Objective" through a key press. There are two setups for the input:

1. External button (default/preferred): If using an external button connected to the recording system.

2. System keyboard: If no external button present, the subject can use the "space bar" on the keyboard of the computer running the task.

## Issues to look out for

1. If you hear intermittent clicks from the speaker, the trigger is present in the audio. This means either the splitter isn't working as expected, or if you didn't intend to use the trigger, the configuration needs to be changed.

2. For some reason, when using certain speakers the left and right channel of the output are flipped, i.e., right is audio, left is trigger. This seems to be speaker-specific, so if you are hearing the trigger only (intermittent clicks), just swap the channels.
