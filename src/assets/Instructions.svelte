    <p>This task consists of three 5-minute blocks of speech.

    <p>Each block consists of a sequence of syllables that don't necessarily make words.

    <p>Once in a while, three connected syllables will make a proper English word.

    <p>Listen carefully for those words.

    <p>One of those proper words is "Objective". Any time you hear "Objective", press the key provided to you.

    <p>At the end of each block, a multiple choice question will ask what words you did
    <span style="font-weight: 500">NOT</span> hear during the task.
